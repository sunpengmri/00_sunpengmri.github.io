1. how to pass the key to lcmodel: Stephen Provencher is no longer available. LCModel is now free software. You can use it by entering (the first time only) the command:
  touch  $HOME/.lcmodel/license 
    and for each analysis the following in Figure 7.7 of the User's Manual:
        key = 210387309 input to control parameters
    Optionally, you can also enter:
        owner = 'your group and laboratory name'

2. SDAT files: must have the extension .SDAT or .sdat. The corresponding SPAR file must be in the same directory with the identical filename, except with the extension .SPAR or .spar, respectively.
3. With SDAT CSI files: Do not do ECC. (Your menus will now be different.)
    • Prior to acquisition, be sure to change the echo acquisition mode to ”Half Echo” (from ”Maximum”).
    • You must use the ”Delayed Reconstruction” option on the raw data (on a system equipped with reconstruction hardware, such as the scanner itself).
    • Set “Spectral correction” & “Ringing filter” to “yes”.
    • Export your data as .SDAT & .SPAR files.
    • Select the .SDAT file with LCMgui. In Fig 6.4 switch off “Do eddy-current correction”

3. With single-voxel SDAT files: If you want to do ECC: In the Philips “post proc” page, set “Spectral correction” to “yes”. Then ECC is automatically done, and you only have to input the file whose name ends in raw act.SDAT.
