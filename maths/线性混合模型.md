关于一般线性模型：
    We used the LMM to compare MDDs with NCs while allowing site-varying effects. LMM describes the relationship between a response variable (e.g., DMN FC) and independent variables (here, diagnosis and covariates of age, sex, education, and head motion), with coefficients that can vary with respect to grouping variables (here, site) (16). We utilized MATLAB’s command fitlme (https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitlme. html)to test the model: y ∼1 + Diagnosis + Age + Sex + Education + Motion + (1 j Site) + (Diagnosis j Site), which yields t and P values for the fixed effect of Diagnosis. Cohen’s d effect size was computed as d= Tðn1 +n2Þ
